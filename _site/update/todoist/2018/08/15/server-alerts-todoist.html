<meta name="description" content="I manage a few different servers for several different friends and clients. As part of managing each server and site hosted on it, I’ll typically receive alerts for errors, common tasks or downtime. For a while I had settled on filing these alerts into a separate mailbox to keep them from overwhelming my inbox. This works for a while, but I’d occasionally miss an important alert or message from one of the servers. In an effort to manage my responsibilities I had started using Todoist to track my responsibilities. I set up an alias pointing to my email to inbox Todoist address, tuned the server alerts for volume and importance and routed them to this new alias. Now, if I get an actionable alert for, say, server downtime, it’s routed to my inbox with all the relevant details to resolve the issue." />
