Hi, I’m Reed! My friends know me as "Erik" (middle name) I’m a Jr developer, technology enthusiast and avid music music fan based in Southern California. 

I have helped a variety of small companies and non profits create and host informationl websites. 

I’m endlessly fascinated by web development, automation and technology. I am constantly striving to learn more and improve on every aspect of what I do. At the moment, I’m particularly interested in JavaScript and mobile development.

I blog occasionally and I read a lot. When I’m not working you can find me out exploring with my amazing wife and family.
